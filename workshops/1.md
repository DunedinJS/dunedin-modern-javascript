# Workshop 1: basics

## Target audience:

Anyone with experience in old-fashioned JavaScript (ES3/ES5) or experience with another mainstream dynamic programming language such as Python, Ruby, or PHP.

## Background:

JavaScript has a reputation for being a 'messy' language so let's forget about browser APIs, DOM, libraries, etc... and go back to basics to uncover its elegant base.
In this workshop we cover some existing JS idioms and how modern language features can improve them.
Sort of like Douglas Crockford's [JavasScript: The Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do) but updated.

##Content:

* block scoping with const and let
* function binding including fat arrow
* template strings (interpolation)
* enhanced object literal features
* destructuring assignment
* rest and spread
* default param values
