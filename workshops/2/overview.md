# Workshop 2: A taste of Modern JavaScript

## Target audience

_Beginner_

Anyone with experience in old-fashioned JavaScript (ES3/ES5) or familiar with another mainstream interpreted programming language such as Python, Ruby, or PHP.

If completely unfamiliar with JavaScript it's recommended you take a look at [Speaking JavaScript](http://speakingjs.com/) by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer.

## Background

JavaScript web application development has changed dramatically since [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) was released in 2010.
It became the first widely used JavaScript framework to separate applications into a model-view-controller structure but was still very much rooted in the jQuery status-quo.

There has been steady progress since then to add modern language features and develop libraries, frameworks, methodologies, and tooling which improve application development.

The aim of this workshop is to give you a taste of working with a modern JavaScript codebase.
We begin with a small starter project with [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) then build a simple application with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/).
These technologies are very popular but by no means the only options.
