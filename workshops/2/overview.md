# Workshop 2: A taste of Modern JavaScript

## Target audience

_Beginner_

Anyone with experience in old-fashioned JavaScript (ES3/ES5) or familiar with another mainstream interpreted programming language such as Python, Ruby, or PHP.

It's recommended you take a look at [Workshop 1](../1/overview.md) to be familiar with some of the modern syntax used in this workshop.

## Background

JavaScript web application development has changed dramatically since ~2010.

Late 2010 saw the release of [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/). It became the first widely used JavaScript framework to separate applications into a model-view-controller structure but was still very much rooted in the jQuery status-quo.

There has been steady progress since then to add modern language features and develop libraries, frameworks, methodologies, and tooling which improve application development from both the developer's and the end-user's perspective.

## Aim

Gain a taste of working with a modern JavaScript codebase.

We begin with a small starter project with [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) then build a simple application with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/).
These technologies are very popular but by no means the only options.
