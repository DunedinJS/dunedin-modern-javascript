# Workshop 2

## Target audience

_Beginner_

Anyone with experience in old-fashioned JavaScript (ES3/ES5) or familiar with another mainstream interpreted programming language such as Python, Ruby, or PHP.

It's recommended you take a look at [Workshop 1](../1/overview.md) to be familiar with some of the modern syntax used in this workshop.

## Requirements

A good text editor with JavaScript syntax support.
[Atom](https://atom.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) are excellent options.

Node.js version 6.9. Other versions may work but 6 is recommended because it has official long-term-support until April 2019.

[Follow these instructions to install Node.js](../../topics/common/nodejs-install.md)

## Part 1: [Migrating an existing app to modern JS](https://github.com/DunedinJS/migrating-to-modern-js)

Take a small old-style JS app, make the source code modular, and introduce modern JS features in a pragmatic way.


## Part 2: [Up and running with a React](./2/overview.md)

Get up and running with a React starter project based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  
_**We will continue to use this in future workshops too**_

## Part 3: [Testing with Jest](./3/overview.md)

An introduction to unit testing with the excellent [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) framework.
