# Workshop 2: a taste of Modern JavaScript

## Target audience

_Beginner_

Anyone with experience in old-fashioned JavaScript (ES3/ES5) or familiar with another mainstream interpreted programming language such as Python, Ruby, or PHP.

It's recommended you take a look at [Workshop 1](../1/overview.md) to be familiar with some of the modern syntax used in this workshop.

## Background

JavaScript web application development has changed dramatically since ~2010.

Late 2010 saw the release of Backbone.js. It became the first widely used JavaScript framework to structure applications applications with clearly separated data, logic, and presentation layers. It was a huge success but still very much a layer atop the jQuery status-quo.

There has been steady progress since then to add modern language features and develop libraries, frameworks, methodologies, and tooling which improve application development from both the developer's and the end-user's perspective.

## Requirements

Node.js version 4 or higher is required. It is recommended to use version 6 because it has much wider support for modern features and has official long-term-support until April 2019.

## Aim

Gain a taste of working with a modern JavaScript codebase.

We begin with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) starter project which provides all the necessary tooling and configuration to start building a application with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

These are by no means the only options but they allow us to take a dive into a relatively standard codebase and apply use some of the modern JavaScript features seen in Workshop 1.

We will also briefly cover Modules and Classes which are new ES6 features that weren't covered in Workshop 1.
