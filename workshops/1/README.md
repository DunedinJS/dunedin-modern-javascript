# Workshop 1: basics

## Target audience:

Anyone with experience in old-fashioned JavaScript (ES3/ES5) or experience with another mainstream interpreted programming language such as Python, Ruby, or PHP.

## Background:

JavaScript has a reputation for being a 'messy' language so let's forget about browser APIs, DOM, libraries, etc... and go back to basics to uncover its elegant base.
In this workshop we cover some existing JS idioms and how modern language features can improve them.
Sort of like Douglas Crockford's [JavasScript: The Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do) but updated.

##Content:

* block scoping with `const` and `let`
* function binding including arrow functions `=>`
* template literals (string interpolation) ``` `hello ${ world }`  ```
* destructuring assignment `[a, b] = [1, 2]`
* rest and spread `[x, ...a]`
* default param values `function(x = 0) {}`
* enhanced object literal features `{ someValue, someMethod() {}, ['key' + x]: 'value' }`
