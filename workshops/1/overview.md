# Workshop 1: basics

## Target audience

Beginner

Anyone with experience in old-fashioned JavaScript (ES3/ES5) or familiar with another mainstream interpreted programming language such as Python, Ruby, or PHP.

## Background

JavaScript has a reputation for being a 'messy' language so let's forget about browser APIs, DOM, libraries, etc... and go back to basics to uncover its elegant base.

The aim od this workshop is to give you enough knowledge of new syntax to understand what's going so that you can participate in further workshops.

We also cover some existing JS idioms and how modern language features can improve them.
Sort of like Douglas Crockford's [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do) but updated. Although the book is now dated it is still a very valuable read.
