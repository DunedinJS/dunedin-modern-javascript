# Up and running with a React

Get up and running with a React starter project based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  
_**We will continue to use this in future workshops too**_

## Background

JavaScript web application development has changed dramatically since ~2010.

Late 2010 saw the release of Backbone.js. It became the first widely used JavaScript framework to structure applications applications with clearly separated data, logic, and presentation layers. It was a huge success but still very much a layer atop the jQuery status-quo.

There has been steady progress since then to add modern language features and develop libraries, frameworks, methodologies, and tooling which improve application development from both the developer's and the end-user's perspective.

## Aim

Gain a taste of working with a modern JavaScript codebase.

We begin with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) an amazing little starter project which provides all the necessary tooling and configuration to start building a application with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

This is by no means the only option but it allows us to take a dive into a relatively standard codebase and apply some of the modern JavaScript features seen in Workshop 1.

We will also briefly cover:

* Modules and Classes which are new ES6 features that weren't covered in Workshop 1
* React and its JSX syntax
* Testing
