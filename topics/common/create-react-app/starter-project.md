# Starter project

We begin with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) which is a small starter project from the Facebook Incubator which provides the necessary tooling to start building a application without being bogged down in comfiguration.

Create React App provides all the tooling and configuration needed:
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to manage the build process and bundle assets for the browser
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) with [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) to compile source code into browser-ready scripts
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) the de-facto standard for linting JavaScript code -- rules are included to catch potential errors
* [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest) a modern testing framework

Now instead of paraphrasing it's best to follow the [Getting Started](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#getting-started) instructions on the Create React App repository.
